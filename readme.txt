Status of Project: Complete.
I would love to add more, but this program achieves the level of functionality I had planned. 

The Eschaton Mini simulator is a basic ‘bomber-type’ game, modified to be a mini version of the game ‘eschaton’ from David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. It is Wallacian at heart, if not in scope. 

Player loads game and either uses initial values of Input Box, or enters their own, and then hit’s ‘Lob!’ to lob their tennis ball toward the towel on the court. Player gets three tries before game is over. If ball comes into contact with towel, game is won. 

What isn’t working (Bugs and/or Next Steps):
With more time, I would have looked into the following: 
Initial values are reset after each turn, rather than retaining previous inputs by user. 
This game would by much cooler with a 3D module such as GlowScript. (link: https://trinket.io/glowscript/bb7befb1ef ) (Play code and right click to rotate simulation around in real-time.)

What you need to know:
In order to play, you need the following, which I’ve included.

Final Thoughts:
Thank you Jeff! This has been a great class, and I look forward to the next one.
